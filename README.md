# TheLibraryApp
1. The color palette is a Split-Complementary Palette. I can create a brown-color, wooden-textured based Library App as a dark-mode option.

2. Add Read/Not-Read Status text inside the Slider button.

3. Task: Remove the sliding button logic for now. Add it after better understanding of Absolute positioning.

4. Even though script.js is in different folder, the positioning defied for the src attribute starts as if image is reached by the index.html page.
